# User Progress Demo - Starter

Welcome! This is The Adpharm's version of a technical assessment.

## Overview

This project is a React (TypeScript) + Vite + Tailwind starter template.

In [src/lib/data.ts](src/lib/data.ts), you will find an AI-generated list of users (usersProgress). Your task is to create a dashboard that displays the list of users and their progress through a set of learning modules.

Your audience is a manager who wants to see how their team is progressing through a set of learning modules. They need to see a list of all users, their progress, and a visual representation of their progress. The information should be easily accessible and quickly understandable at a glance.

## Requirements

- Display the list of users and their progress through the learning modules.
- Display the questions and answers in a way that is easy to read and understand.
- Ensure the interface is mobile responsive.

## What We're Looking For

- Problem-Solving Ability:
  - How do you display a list of users and their progresses in the most effective way? A table? Cards? Some other way?
  - How do you account for mobile responsiveness? Is it clear that mobile was considered in the design? Or was it an afterthought?
- Design and Functionality: Your ability to create a design that is both functional and visually appealing.
- Simplicity: Avoid over-engineering or over-abstraction.

## BONUS!!

As a bonus, if you can develop your dashboard in the style of [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), you will receive extra points. ([See docs/img/ for screenshots](docs/img/) of Loom's style NOTE: this is just for you to get a sense of the style - you do not have to use any/all of the components shown). You do not need to create a sidebar or modify the navigation - focus solely on the dashboard. For example, if you choose to use a table to display the data, make it look like Loom's table. If you include any buttons, design them to resemble Loom's buttons. You get the idea.

**If you can pull this off successfully, you're pretty much job-ready as far as we're concerned!**
